                            At ParkUpp, we are a family of young, diverse, creative and somewhat
                            quirky individuals setting out to solve the nightmare that is urban
                            parking.                        
                            <br/><br/>
                            The ParkUpp idea was born out of a simple observation, where we
                            noticed the incredible amount of under-utilised private parking spaces
                            in areas where demand for parking was particularly high.
                            <br/><br/>
                            ParkUpp has created an effective peer-to-peer marketplace that
                            connects homeowners with idle driveways, garages and unused
                            parking spaces to drivers who are in need of parking.                            
                            When you purchase a vehicle, it never crosses your mind that your car
                            will be parked 95% of the time.
                            <br/><br/>
                            In stating that, we all know that with owning a vehicle comes the
                            responsibility and more often than not the unwanted headache of
                            attempting to find a parking space, especially in those densely
                            populated urban areas.                            
                            But, no need to worry any more! Riding on the wave of a sharing
                            economy, ParkUpp now offers a simple yet ingenious and ubiquitous
                            service that solves your parking hassle whilst unlocking a new source
                            of income for homeowners.
